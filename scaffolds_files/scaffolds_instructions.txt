Scaffolds files should be save in this folder when using the scaffolds entry point.
You will need to add the name of the sample, for each scaffolds file to be run, to the samplesheet, scaffolds_list.csv, which is found in the assets folder.
Press 'ENTER' or 'RETURN' then type in each additional sample name on the next line to add additional samples to your list.
Your final listed sample should NOT be followed by a blank, new line.
Do NOT add spaces or any other characters before or after each sample name!
Please delete your saved scaffolds files once you've verified that your analysis was completed on all samples.
